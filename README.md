## What ADM Is 

##### ADM is the operating system for Enterprise Architecture.

##### <ins>It answers</ins>:

- What architecture work should be done?

- In what order?

- With what inputs and outputs?

- How do we move from strategy to execution?

##### ADM ensures architecture is:

- Business-driven

- Capability-focused

- Governed

- Continuously improved

The TOGAF ADM Cycle

ADM is iterative, not linear. Architects loop through phases as strategy, technology, or delivery changes.
